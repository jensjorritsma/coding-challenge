Usage:
from comparison import comparison

Method:
compare_values(x, y)

The compare_values method takes two semantic version strings as variables and compares them.  It returns -1 when first string is less than second string, returns 1 when first string is greater than second string, and returns 0 when both values are equal.  If either value does not match semantic versioning guidelines, it returns false and does not compare.
